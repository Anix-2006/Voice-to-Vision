# Voice-to-Vision
Voice to vision is a web application that converts English or Hindi speech/text into Sign Language videos.

The system uses speech recognition powered by OpenAI’s Whisper model and dynamically generates a translated sign language video by stitching together word-level or letter-level sign clips.

This project was developed for a Hackathon with the goal of reducing communication barriers between hearing individuals and the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community.
